# About

Hey, I am Lukas Wirth, a Computer Science Student at the University of Paderborn. This mdbook will hopefully be home to a lot of random blogs in the future.

I mainly use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for my programming projects and one of my projects I am currently working on is designing and implementing a small embeddable scripting language. It is very likely to make an appearance on this blog at some point but currently only the parser exists, meaning I am far from being able to show it off.

My github: [https://github.com/veykril](https://github.com/veykril)
